My take on the classic Snake Game. Use the arrow keys to move, collect apples, and don't crash into yourself!

How to run:
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Make sure all files above are in the same directory
3. Run ```javac Main.java``` from a terminal window in that directory
4. Run ```java Main``` from a terminal window in that directory
5. Have fun!
